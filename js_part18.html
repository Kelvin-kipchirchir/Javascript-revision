	<title>JS SLEEP</title>
	<h2>Introducing JS sleep/wait</h2>
</head>
<body>
<!-- 
PHP,and c both have sleep(sec) function to pause excecution for a fixed amout of time
java has thread.sleep()
3.python time.sleep()
4.go has time.sleep(2*time.second
js does't have sleep() function but we can create using feature such as promises and async/wait functions
await is used for a promise and can only be used in an async function
-behavopur of js is asynchronous,hence then the concept of promise to handle such asynchronous behaviour
-because of this aynchronous behaviour;it continues its work and does not wait for anything during execution
-Async/wait function help us to write code in a sysncronous manner
syntax for sleep:
sleep(delayTime in milliseconds.then())=>{
	code to be excecuted
} 
-sleep function can be used along with async/wait to get the pause between the excecution
syntax
const func = async() => {
    await sleep(delayTime in milliseconds)
    //code to be excecuted
}func()
In example below we are using sleep() function with the async/await functionalities.There is a function func() is defined with some statements .initially the text "Hello world " is displayed on screen after function started
then because of sleep function in func() paused for 2 seconds
-After completing of given time period,the text "welcome to dragon empire,com will be displayed on screen and repeated till termination of the loop"
text is going to be be repeated 10 times on screen with a pause of 2 seconds on every iteration of loop


-->
<h2>Example of using sleep() in javascript</h2>

<h2>Example 2 of using sleep() in js</h2>
<p>There is a sleep in 2000 milliseconds</p>

</body>
<script type="text/javascript">
	function sleep(milliseconds){
		return new Promise(resolve=>setTimeout(resolve,milliseconds))
	}
	async function func(){
		document.write("Hello world");
		for(let i = 1;i<=10;i++){
			await sleep(2000)
			document.write(i+""+"welcome to dragon empire.com"+""+"<br>")
		}
	}
	//func();
/*
Example 2
creating a promise with the setTimeout function.The setTimeOut() function excecutes code after a specified amount of time
-also using the then() method which executes requird function after completing the promise
-initially some of the statements are displayed on the screen then after a delayed of two seconds text "end" is displayed
-Aproach is prefered to delay a function*/

//example 2
let sleeping = ms =>{
	return new Promise(resolve=>setTimeout(resolve,ms))
}
document.write("Begin"+"<br>")
document.write("Welcome to the dragon empire.com"+"<br");
sleeping(2000).then(()=>{
	document.write("end");
});
//after excecution code b;javascript sleep/wait.After delay of 2 seconds output javascript sleep/wait
</script>
