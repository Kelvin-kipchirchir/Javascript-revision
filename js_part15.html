<p>How to calculate the difference between two dates by using js.<br>
	Using the right methods,date object is required to calculate the difference between dates in js.<br>
js date object can be used to get a year month or a day</p>
<p>calculating the differnce between two dates </p>

<h5>Example 1</h5>
<p>getting the nunber of days between the specified 2dates.we are applying an option and calculate the difference</p>
<p>we define 2 dates using new dates(),then calculate the time difference betwwen both specified dates by using in built getTime()<br>
then calculate no of days by dividing the difference between both dates by no of milliseconds<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Javascript date format</strong></p>
<p>can be used to get a year,month and day and can be used to display timer on web page with<br> help of js date object<br>there are many types of date format<br> ISO Date-International standard:2021-12-24(yyyy-mm-dd) while short date 24/12/2021<br>
long date-Aug 01 2021 or 01 Aug 2021</p>
