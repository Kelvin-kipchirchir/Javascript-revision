javascript redirect
mechanism for sending search engines and users on a different url from the original one.redircted page can also be on the same server or different server;can also be on same website or differrnt one
when we click url we redirect to another url;happens due to page redirection
-different from refreshing a web page 
-search engines do not analyze the javascript to check the redirection.its required to notify the search engine(SEO) about url forwarding,we need to add the rel="cannonical" tag within the head sectionof the web page 
There are several methods used to perform page redirection such as
->Location.href()
->Location.replace()
->page redirection is easy in js
window.location and windowlocation.href()
1.window.location()
property of window object.there are several methods to redirect the web page.Almost all methods are related to window.local obj
can be used for getting the address of the current url or the web address
window.location can be written without adding window preffix
2.Location.replace()
commonly used window.location object used for replacing original document with new one.
using this method we can pass new url and then perform an HTTP redirect.it is different from href as it removes the current document from document history 
-hence not possible to navigate back to original document
syntax::window.Location.replace("new url")
example
example of page redirection on the client-side,to redirect a web page we simply have to write a statement
->a buttomn that redirects visitors to javatpoint.com

->we can use SetTimeOut() method which automatically redirects the user to the appropriate link.It would take time to load a new page 
SetTimeOut() method executes another function after a given interval
